# Eilis-McMillan-Portfolio

## Description

This web application is a profile providing both information about myself, and displaying a portfolio of some of my web development projects thus far. It serves as a central location to access my deployed applications in a nicely formatted web application, which further showcases my abilities.

This application can therefore be sent to potential employers, colleagues, etc., in order to showcase my work, and provide the opportunity to get in contact with me. In addition, links to other relevant social media is present, such as github and linkedin.


## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The portfolio website contains information about myself and a showcase of my current deployed web applications. It can be accessed using the url: ##. Beneath the header, there are three links that redirect you to the relevant section of the page. These sections are: 'About me', 'Portfolo', and 'Contact'. 

This web application is screen display responsive. When on smaller screen displays, such as mobiles or tablets, the profile image and 'about me' section will appear part of the main content section. Alternatively, when on desktops, these section will appear in a side bar. The social media icons within this act as links and can be clicked.

In the portfolio section, each project is separated by boxes. The images act as links, and when pressed, will redirect users to the specific deployed application. 

The application also includes a contact form, which is separated into text input sections; users are prompted to fill out this form in same format outlined by the suggested text that appears in the box prior to clicking.
